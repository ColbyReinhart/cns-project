# SHA3-256 Python Implementation
An implementation of SHA3-256 in the Python programming language.

This repo contains our implementation in sha3.py as well as tests for collision, execution speed (both in test_collision.py), and pseudo-randomness (in test_random.py).

To run either test, run the script with "python FILENAME" with no arguments. The implementation can also be executed by running sha3_run.py with no arguments.
